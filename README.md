# üéì Academic Machine Learning Project: Telecommunications Customer Churn - From Prediction to Proactive Retention

## ‚ú® Project Showcase: Mastering Telecom Churn with Advanced AI üß†

This is a **rigorous academic machine learning project** that addresses the critical challenge of customer churn in the telecommunications sector üìâ. We move far beyond standard classification to build a **time-aware, interpretable, and scientifically grounded** retention solution.

The core innovation lies in answering the two most vital business questions: **'When is the risk highest?'** (using Survival Analysis) and **'Why are they leaving?'** (using Explainable AI - XAI). This integrated approach provides truly **proactive** and **actionable** intelligence.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Methodology: The CRISP-DM Framework

This entire project rigorously follows the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology. Below is a brief summary of the key steps completed in each phase:

| CRISP-DM Phase | Key Steps Executed |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Business Understanding** | Defined the **Business Objectives (BO)** (e.g., Maximize CLV) and **Data Science Objectives (DSO)** (e.g., Time-to-Event Modeling) to guide the analysis. |
| **2. Data Understanding** | Performed initial data exploration on the telecom churn dataset (`churn-bigml-*`). Identified the significant **Class Imbalance** (approx. 85% Non-Churn vs. 15% Churn). |
| **3. Data Preparation** | Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and performed **Feature Engineering** (e.g., creating time-based variables for Survival Analysis). |
| **4. Modeling** | Built and tuned several ensemble models (**Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **AdaBoost**, **Decision Tree**). Implemented **Survival Analysis** and integrated **LIME** for interpretation. |
| **5. Evaluation** | Assessed models using metrics relevant to imbalanced data and business impact (**AUC**, **F1-Score**, False Negatives rate) to select the best performer. |
| **6. Deployment** | Finalized the model and prepared the **interpretable output** (**LIME explanations**) as a deliverable for decision-makers and retention strategy teams. |

## üéØ Project Objectives: Business vs. Data Science

Grounded in the **Business Understanding** phase of CRISP-DM, we clearly define our goals:

### Business Objectives (BO) üìà

| Objective | Technical Term/Metric Focus |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Maximize Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** | Minimize **Churn Rate** and reduce **Cost of Acquisition (CoA)** relative to **CLV**. |
| **2. Enhance Customer Loyalty & Experience** | Identify **Root Causes** of churn using feature importance to guide targeted service improvements. |
| **3. Implement Proactive Retention Strategy** | Enable **Real-Time Intervention** by defining a precise **Risk Threshold** for offer delivery. |
| **4. Mitigate Revenue Loss** | Minimize **False Negatives** (missed churners) to protect the revenue stream. |

### Data Science Objectives (DSO) üß™

| Objective | Key Methodology/Metric |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Time-Sensitive Churn Modeling** | Implement **Survival Analysis** (**Kaplan-Meier** & **CoxPH Fitter**) to model **Time-to-Event**. |
| **2. Ensure Model Interpretability** | Utilize **Explainable AI (XAI)**, specifically **LIME**, for both **Local** and **Global** model explanations. |
| **3. Optimize Predictive Performance** | Achieve high **Area Under the Curve (AUC)** and a balanced **F1-Score** despite the **Class Imbalance** (approx. 85:15 ratio). |
| **4. Robust Feature Identification** | Perform **Feature Selection** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to isolate the highest-impact churn drivers. |

## üí° The Cutting-Edge Methodology

Our project focuses on delivering **actionable intelligence** by combining advanced techniques, fulfilling the **Modeling** and **Evaluation** phases of CRISP-DM:

### 1. Ensemble Learning for Churn Classification ü§ñ
We utilized a suite of high-performance models, including **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, **AdaBoost**, and **Decision Trees**, to effectively handle the complex, non-linear relationships in the dataset and establish a robust baseline prediction for churn probability.

### 2. Survival Analysis (Time-to-Event Modeling) ‚è≥
Using the **Kaplan-Meier Fitter** and **Cox Proportional Hazards (CoxPH) Fitter** from the `lifelines` library, we transform the churn problem from a simple classification into a **time-based risk probability model**.
This delivers a 'survival curve' for each customer, providing crucial insight into **WHEN** their risk peaks, directly supporting the **Real-Time Intervention** BO.

### 3. Explainable AI (XAI) with LIME üî¨
We integrate **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations)**.
This approach generates **local explanations** (Why is this specific customer about to churn?) and **global explanations** (Which features drive churn overall?), ensuring model trust and directly addressing the **Business Objective** of finding **Root Causes**.
